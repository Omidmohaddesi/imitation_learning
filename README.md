# Learning from Gamettes

This repository contains the code for the CHI 2020 Extended Abstract paper [Learning from Gamettes: Imitating Human Behavior in Supply Chain Decisions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3334480.3382996) for imitating the behavior of [Gamette](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376571) players in supply chain decisions. The code compares the performance of a nonlinear regression model with [Behavioral Cloning](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~claude/papers/MI15.pdf) and [Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/file/cc7e2b878868cbae992d1fb743995d8f-Paper.pdf).  

The code uses gameplay trajectories and decisions of human players who interacted with the [CRISP](https://gitlab.com/syifan/crisp) simulation through a Gamette environment. For the imitation learning task, the repository relies on a partially observable environment called *gym-crisp* which I developed using [OpenAI's Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) toolkit. 

## Dependencies

1. TensorFlow 1.14.0
2. Stable Baselines 2.10.2a1
3. Gym 0.18.0

## Dataset
The dataset used for imitation includes players' decisions collected using a Gamette in 3 conditions in a between-subject experimental setting. The experimental conditions include variations depending on the type of simulation agents that players interacted with (i.e., Human-like vs. Order-Up-To-Level (OUL) agents) and whether or not players received a suggestion on optimal decision in case they interacted with OUL agents (OUL with suggestion vs. OUL without suggestion).

## Hierarchical Clustering
Since Behavioral Cloning and GAIL rely on multiple trajectories per human expert, we performed a clustering analysis on playersâ€™ actions over time for each of the three conditions in our dataset, and used the largest clusters of players as expert trajectories to be used for each algorithm.

## Performance
We tested the performance of each algorithm by considering different number of trajectories in the training set using a sorted list of players based on their total cost from the major cluster.
